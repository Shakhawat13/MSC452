<h1> <b>  <p Style="Color:#2d81c6;">  <p Style="font-size:50px;">My Introduction </p> </b> </h1>
<p>I am Md. Shakawat Hossain from Brac University. I am doing my major in Marketing and E-commerce.
I do concentrate in dual major because I think this will help me in my future.With a passion for business,
social media, and all things marketing, I have both the skill set and professional background necessary to
dive deep into the marketing world. As an upbeat, self-motivated team player with good communication,
I envision an exciting future in the industry. As I concentrate on Marketing background, I think great
communication skills are essential. For that reason, A marketer needs to understand the requirements 
of the client and be able to present ideas and concepts. Being able to stay organized and work in a fast
paced environment is also an essential skill and I am good at this. Besides a career in e-commerce is 
relatively new in Bangladesh. E-commerce is a good combination of marketing that I believe. It can give
me the perfect knowledge of the online and physical way of marketing that basically help me to know the 
surroundings of the marketing arena. </p>

<p> As Bangladeshis, complaining about different issues is pretty much a part and parcel of our life and 
it is very much understandable since Dhaka City has recently been ranked as the ‘Third Worst City to Live
 in’. The problem is that, all these complaining that we do throughout our life falls on deaf ear and never 
really creates a solution. Or there are people who really want to make a change, but for lack of a platform,
 fails to do so. That’s where we, ‘Better Life’, can come into play. Our aim is basically to create a platform
 through which we can make changes, Social and Environmental changes specifically. Ours will be a Map-based 
platform where people can report problems at different locations with the help of our Mobile App. People can 
share their experiences about various problems they have faced in different locations inside the Dhaka city 
(ex.: Lack of lighting on streets, absence of manhole coverings, structural problems etc.). Through our app, 
people can shed light on these different issues and report these to us. After which, each of the problems 
will be attempted to be solved by joint effort of us, the public and the government. Through this, we can 
react faster on arising problems, involve people in social movements, find new ways to improve the city life
 and even attract people to different volunteer programs. The people actually looking to volunteer in these
 projects do not really find a platform and for lack of connectivity to various volunteer organization, they
 lose the motivation of doing anything. Through our app, we can create a platform for all these where people 
can actually feel like they can help make a change. We are planning to generate money for these projects 
through the Mobile App. Some money will be generated through the App itself. However, people can donate money
 for different issues too. Depending on the gravity on the problem, we can take action by ourselves or even 
enlist the help of the government or Philanthropic organizations. People can post the problems on the maps and
 view the list of reported issues through the Mobile App and Web. We can integrate our system directly with 
governmental institutions and local council platforms. Furthermore, we can integrate our system with various 
NGOs and NPOs too.
So, this project of ours is to create a platform where everyone will be heard, everyone’s concern will be taken 
into consideration, every problem will be detected and by creating solutions to them by everyone’s joint efforts,
 we can make Dhaka City one of the best in the world. We believe that everyone’s cooperation, governmental 
institutions and philanthropic organizations will give us a real chance in achieving our objective of making 
Dhaka city great again.</p>
